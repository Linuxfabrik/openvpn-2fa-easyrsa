# openvpn-2fa-easyrsa

Bash scripts to manage OpenVPN users, their certificates with Easy-RSA and TOTP based 2FA codes (including QR code). How to use these scripts is described in our [Open Source Admin Manual](https://docs.linuxfabrik.ch/software/openvpn.html#variante-mit-easyrsa-und-viel-komfort).

Place these files in `/usr/local/bin`. Credits to https://github.com/perfecto25/openvpn_2fa, who inspired us a lot.
